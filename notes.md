Learning times is a pain.

Might need a note letting us know that the 5 day forecast is always missing the midnight of the first day. I spent forever figuring out what was missing.

Also, 5 day stuff is more involved than the one day was.

The forecast array from openweathermap API is NOT always 5 days, 8 readings, 3 hr periods. The first day is sometimes 7, other times 6 readings. It is really annoying when trying to run loops on loops.
